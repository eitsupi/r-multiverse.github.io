## How to install a package from R-releases

R has built-in support for multiple repositories. Simply add R-releases to your repository settings:

```r
options(repos = c("https://r-releases.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos")))
```

This only needs to be done once per session. We recommend adding it to your `.Rprofile` so that it is always available.

Alternatively, to prioritize CRAN over R-releases:

```r
options(repos = c(getOption("repos"), "https://r-releases.r-universe.dev"))
```

Then proceed to use `install.packages()` or `pak::pak()` etc. as you would normally.

## A home for non-CRAN packages

Many R packages do not belong on CRAN. In particular, packages containing compiled code may require toolchains or binary downloads that fall outside of CRAN policy.

By [contributing](contributors.qmd) a package to R-releases, you may conveniently install the latest released versions of these packages from a single repository location.

## A guarantee of package availability

R-releases is designed to work seamlessly alongside CRAN. By prioritizing CRAN in the settings above, you can continue to get your packages from CRAN, only using R-releases as a fall-back.

A package may become unavailable on CRAN at any time due to its strict archival policy.

- Sometimes due to the archival of a dependency, and outside the maintainer's direct control.
- Situations can be temporary, but may take an extended time to resolve.

By [contributing](contributors.qmd) a package that you rely on, you can ensure that it remains available for your critical workflows.

## A direct distribution channel from maintainers

Maintainers may use R-releases as a faster release channel, especially for packages under intensive development. 

CRAN is first and foremost an archival network, and its policy restricts the frequency of package updates. R-releases allows maintainers to push critical updates or bug fixes directly to users.

If a package maintainer recommends that you install a package from R-releases, please prioritize R-releases in front of CRAN in the repository settings above.
