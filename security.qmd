Security threats and vulnerabilities affect everyone using R-multiverse. Issues may include (but are not limited to):

* Unauthorized access to <https://github.com/r-multiverse> or its repositories.
* Malicious attempts to inundate <https://github.com/r-multiverse/contributions> with pull requests.
* Other [denial of service attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) on the [R-multiverse bot](https://github.com/apps/r-multiverse) or other infrastructure.

In the event of a vulnerability or active threat, please consider to [report it privately](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) for the R-multiverse administrators to address confidentially. This is often more appropriate than announcing such issues publicly at <https://github.com/r-multiverse/help>.

The steps to privately report vulnerabilities are:

1. Navigate to <https://github.com/r-multiverse/help/security>.
2. Under "Private vulnerability reporting", click "Report a vulnerability".
3. Describe the issue in the advisory details form.
4. At the bottom, click "Submit report". GitHub will then add you as a collaborator on the proposed security advisory you created.
