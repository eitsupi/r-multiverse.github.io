R-multiverse is a community-curated collection of R package releases, powered by [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev).

Anyone can contribute packages in the GitHub repository at <https://github.com/r-multiverse/contributions>. Once a package is registered, [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/) automatically builds and checks every new release and makes it available to install from <https://r-multiverse.r-universe.dev/>. Package maintainers have complete control over deployment.

The R-multiverse project originated from the [R Consortium Repositories Working Group](https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg).
