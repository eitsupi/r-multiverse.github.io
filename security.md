Security threats and vulnerabilities affect everyone using R-multiverse. Issues may include (but are not limited to):

* Malware in R packages contributed to R-multiverse.
* Unauthorized access to <https://github.com/r-multiverse> or its repositories.
* Malicious attempts to inundate <https://github.com/r-multiverse/contributions/pulls> with pull requests.
* Other [denial of service (DoS) attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) on the [R-multiverse bot](https://github.com/apps/r-multiverse) or other infrastructure.

# Protecting R-multiverse users

If you notice a security issue or other vulnerability in an R package contributed to R-multiverse, please report it:

1. Open an issue at <https://github.com/r-multiverse/help>. In the comments, please notify the R-multiverse administrators and moderators using `@r-multiverse/administrators` and `@r-multiverse/moderators`, respectively.
2. Add the affected versions of the package to the [R Consortium Advisory Database](https://github.com/RConsortium/r-advisory-database).

# Protecting R-multiverse

Please help keep R-multiverse operational.

## Public attacks

In the event of publicly visible malicious activity in R-multiverse infrastructure, such as a [DoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) on <https://github.com/r-multiverse/contributions/pulls>, please:

1. [Report abuse or spam](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam) through GitHub.
2. Open an issue at <https://github.com/r-multiverse/help> to inform R-multiverse administrators and moderators.

## Private vulnerability reporting

If you notice a vulnerability that an attacker has not yet exploited, please [report it privately](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
Confidentiality helps fix the problem before most attackers even know about it.
After remediation, R-multiverse administrators will open an issue at <https://github.com/r-multiverse/help> to inform community about the vulnerability and its resolution.

The steps to [privately report vulnerabilities](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) are:

1. Navigate to <https://github.com/r-multiverse/help/security>.
2. Under "Private vulnerability reporting", click "Report a vulnerability".
3. Describe the issue in the advisory details form.
4. At the bottom, click "Submit report". GitHub will then add you as a collaborator on the proposed security advisory you created.
